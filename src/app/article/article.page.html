        <p class="introduction">
          Each year billions of dollars are lost to fraudulent activities. Telemarketing, health care, home equity and home improvement fraud and identity theft are just a few of the scams conducted over the phone, by mail, through the internet and door-to-door. Seniors are often targets as criminals focus on their vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">Here are some guidelines to help ensure the safety of your assets:</h3>
        <ul class="guidelines">
          <li>Never give out your Social Security, credit card or bank account numbers.</li>
          <li>Destroy personal information on documents before discarding them—use a shredder if possible.</li>
          <li>Don't fall for things that sound too good to be true—money, vacations, sweepstakes prizes, health cures, or low risk/high yield investment schemes.</li>
          <li>Do not agree to any home improvement or sales contract until you verify the existence and reputation of the business. Be sure all contractors you hire are licensed, bonded and insured.</li>
          <li>Have a lawyer or someone you trust examine any document before you sign it.</li>
          <li>Don't give money to a charitable organization until you verify its legitimacy by contacting the Attorney General's Office. Legitimate organizations do not require immediate response and should provide information by mail.</li>
          <li>Never send cash in the mail, or allow anyone to pick up a check at your home.</li>
        </ul>
